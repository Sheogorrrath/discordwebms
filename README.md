# Discord Webm Compilation
A complilation of all the best Discord .webm files I've managed to find *(so far)*...

This complitation is **not** complete and is being added to regularly. 

# Contributions Coming Soon... 
When contributions are open, just pull a request.

# Important Note
Please note that I do not own any of the files included in this compliation nor did I create this; I've put this archive together as a fun way of putting these together and sharing these to all fellow memers! 

It is also worth noting that some of the files have audio attached, some of which may be **very loud**. Please be concious of this! :loud_sound: 

Enjoy :)
